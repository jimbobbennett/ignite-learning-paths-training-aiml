## Session Abstract

**Using Pre-Built AI to Solve Business Challenges**

As a data-driven company, Tailwind Traders understands the importance of using
artificial intelligence to improve business processes and delight customers.
Before investing in an AI team, their existing developers were able to
demonstrate some quick wins using pre-built AI technologies. 

In this session, we show how you can use Azure Cognitive Services to implement
the "Shop by Photo" feature in the Tailwind Traders website, and explain the
workings of the neural networks behind computer vision. We will also show how
the website layout automatically adapts to optimize engagement of anonymous
users thanks to reinforcement learning and the Personalizer service.

Finally, we'll review the cost, data regulation, and ethical concerns you should
think about before putting AI into production.
